# SimpleRushRoyale

Idea comes from Rush Royale game, which is one of my favorite game, so me and my girlfriend are trying to make a similar game so that if we were beated in the real game, we can come to this simple game to find some hapiness 0.0

Latest Version (0.0.1):
  1. Added attack function to cards so they will not just look at enemies to destroy their homebase anymore xd:)
  2. New type of enemies! Now we have SmallBoss which has more health than Minions. (No skills still but we are working at it)
  3. Now enemies will not be randomly generated, instead it depends on round time, every 15 seconds a smallboss will appear on board.
