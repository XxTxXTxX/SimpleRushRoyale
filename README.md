# SimpleRushRoyale

Idea comes from Rush Royale game, which is one of my favorite game, so me and my girlfriend are trying to make a similar game so that if we were beated in the real game, we can come to this simple game to find some hapiness 0.0

Version (0.0.1):
  1. Added attack function to cards so they will not just look at enemies to destroy their homebase anymore xd:)
  2. New type of enemies! Now we have SmallBoss which has more health than Minions. (No skills still but we are working at it)
  3. Now enemies will not be randomly generated, instead it depends on round time, every 15 seconds a smallboss will appear on board.

Latest Version (0.0.2):
    The brand newest version now is coming! Let's see what is being update 
  1. Added attack, combine, etc methods to player, so player now can 
  "Spawn" card on the board, combine them to higher level, or attack 
  whichever enemies you want. Also "Mana System" is adding to the game, 
  now create a new card cost you mana (depends on how many card you create,
  create more means cost more). 
  2. Enemies now spawn automatically, and round system also added into the 
  game so now enemies may be stronger (Getting more health and attack to 
  players).
  3. Improved performance and code is much more clean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


2023/01/23 ----------

  1. Added new feature Mana System, now it allows players to get mana at the beginning of each round, so players won't be so boring to attack a strong enemy for infinite rounds :)
  2. "Attack Speed" feature for cards is removed, we initially want to create a game that allows all the cards attacking enemies together, however there had some technical difficulties so we changed game mode to Turn Based game, thus "Attack Speed" is no longer useful for current game mode.
